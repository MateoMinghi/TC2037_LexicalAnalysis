"STC0101
 Implementaci贸n de algoritmos computacionales"	The implementation of the algorithms works correctly
	The program includes automated tests that show the algorithm works properly
	both: best practices and correct style are followed in the implementation


"STC0102
Optimizaci贸n de algoritmos computacionales"	Time and space complexity are correctly analyzed
	At least two correct solutions were presented.  (regex vs automata)
	A benchmark of the solutions is presented and analyzed.


"STC0103
 Generaci贸n de modelos computacionales"	The model is clearly explained through a diagram. (the automata and regex) 
	A complete explanation of the rational of the model is presented beside the diagram
	The explanation contains the theoretical/mathematical backing for the ideas presented in the model, formal references must be included and properly cited IEEE or APA.


"STC0104
Implementaci贸n de modelos computacionales"	The implementation of the model is consistent with the documentation generated.
	The Implemented model also contains a set of documented tests to show that the model works as intended and correctly solves the problem
	The program passes successfully all the tests
